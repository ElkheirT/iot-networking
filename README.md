# IoT Computer Vision Networking App
---

## What
- A webcam that streams a live feed and can send the user a notification if it detects motion or people.

## Why
- Home security remains an important issue. Recently, for example, there have been several cases of thieves stealing packages from peopleâ€™s porches and front doors. A security camera can help to keep a log of who enters or approaches a home.

## How
- A development board such as a Raspberry Pi/Pi Zero W can be used as a server which streams a live feed and sends notifications to a client.

## Deliverables
1. Network App (IoT Computer Vision)
2. Documentation
